// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
// let car = 'subaru';
// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
// console.log(car == 'subaru')
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
var x = 10;
var y = 5;
console.log("1. Is x < y? I predict False.");
console.log(x < y);
console.log("2. Is x > y? I predict True.");
console.log(x > y);
console.log("3. Is x <= y? I predict False.");
console.log(x <= y);
console.log("4. Is x >= y? I predict True.");
console.log(x >= y);
console.log("5. Is x == y? I predict False.");
console.log(x == y);
console.log("6. Is x != y? I predict True.");
console.log(x != y);
console.log("7. Is x === y? I predict False.");
console.log(x === y);
console.log("8. Is x !== y? I predict True.");
console.log(x !== y);
console.log("9. Is x + y > x - y? I predict True.");
console.log(x + y > x - y);
console.log("10. Is x * y < x + y? I predict False.");
console.log(x * y < x + y);
