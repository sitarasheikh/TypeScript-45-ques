// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

    if (additional_info.length > 0) {
        // Iterate through each additional_info and split it by '=' to get the key and value
        for (let info of additional_info) {
